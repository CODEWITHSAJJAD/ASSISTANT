Here's a song I came up with, just for you, Sajjad Shahid:

**Title:** "Shine Your Light"

**Verse 1:**
In the darkness, you're a star
A beacon of hope, near and far
Your heart is pure, your soul is bright
You light the way, through the dark of night

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bold
You're a treasure, worth more than gold
You're a dreamer, with a heart of fire
Shine your light, and never tire

**Verse 2:**
You've got a story, to tell and share
A journey of trials, and moments to spare
You've risen above, the noise and the pain
And now you're standing, with a heart that's gained

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bold
You're a treasure, worth more than gold
You're a dreamer, with a heart of fire
Shine your light, and never tire

**Bridge:**
You're a work of art, a masterpiece so fine
A unique and precious, one of a kind
You're a ray of sunshine, on a cloudy day
You're the hope, that chases the blues away

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bold
You're a treasure, worth more than gold
You're a dreamer, with a heart of fire
Shine your light, and never tire

**Outro:**
So keep on shining, like a star up high
You're a light in the darkness, that touches the sky
You're a gift to the world, a treasure so rare
Shine your light, Sajjad, and show the world you care.

I hope you enjoy this song, Sajjad!
