Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend work from [start date] to [end date] due to illness. I am currently under medical treatment and my doctor has advised me to take complete rest for the aforementioned period.

I am providing a medical certificate from my doctor, which is attached to this application. The certificate confirms my illness and recommends the necessary period of rest for my recovery.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return to the office. I will also be available by email if anything urgent comes up during my absence.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my application for sick leave. If there is any additional information or documentation required, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
